<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
[Automatic Car Air Freshener](https://www.pakwheels.com/forums/t/automatic-car-air-freshener/208305)

<!--- Include information about why this project is related to yours. --->
*I would say the concept of this is related to my project as it uses a motor drive and fan to function the air freshener where as mine will be splashing water.*

![Image](temperature-sensor.JPG)

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
[Temperature Sensor Microbit](https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/input/temperature)

<!--- Include information about why this project is related to yours. --->
*This project is related to mine as I used the code from this to code my temperature sensor for my water spray.*
<!--- Repeat code above for a total of 6 related projects --->

### *Temperature Gauge* ###

<!--- Modify code to insert image of related project below --->
![Image](gauge.JPG)

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
[Temperature Gauge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi3Km1PV45M)

<!--- Include information about why this project is related to yours. --->
*The concept of this is similar to mine where there is a gauge is driven by  microbit and used to detect temperature. as the temperature goes up the gauge rotates and that similar to mine, however a motor/pump will be used to spray or splash water onces at a certain high temperature.*

### *Drive Motor - Kitroniks Book* ###

<!--- Modify code to insert image of related project below --->
![Image](drive-motor.JPG)

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
[Drive Motor](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/blog/experiment-4-using-a-transistor-to-drive-a-motor/)

<!--- Include information about why this project is related to yours. --->
*For this I have used the code from this to power up my motor. The code in this tells the motor to switch on to full power after a few seconds and then switches off then repeats the process again. However I altered the coded from that to start the motor when it reaches a high temperature.*

### *Automatic Watering System* ###

<!--- Modify code to insert image of related project below --->
![Image](321.JPG)

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
[Automatic Watering System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGvCaV3lIfw)

<!--- Include information about why this project is related to yours. --->
*This is related to my project, as my intended idea was to use a water pump to spray water. With this project it pumps out water when the soil is not wet, whereas mine will do something similar to that but with raise in temperature, the water pump will spay water.*
<!--- Repeat code above for a total of 6 related projects --->

## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. --->

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
*My Design intent is to create a wristband for people wear while they are out exercising. The product it be a temperature sensor spray with sprays out water when it reaches high temperatures to keep you fresh and hydrated.*
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
